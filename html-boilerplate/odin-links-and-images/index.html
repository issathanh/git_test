    <h1>Homepage</h1>
    <h2> Opening links on the same tab: </h2>
    <p> To open links on the same tab you use: <strong><"a href = links></strong>  </p>
    <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">About The Odin Project</a>
    <h2> Opening links on different tab:</h2>
    <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">About The Odin Project</a>
    <h3> a parameter definition</h3>
        <ul> 
            <li><strong>href:</strong> specifies the destination link</li>
            <li><strong>target:</strong> specifies where the linked resourcce wil be opened <em>Default = _self</em> which opens the link in the current tab</li>
            <li><strong>target = "_blank":</strong> opens link on a new tab </li>
            <li><strong>rel:</strong>describe the relationship between the current page and linked document</li>
            <li><strong>rel = "noopener":</strong>a value of ref, ensures that links opened in a new tab or window cannot interact with or access the original page. without it, the new page can use JavaScript to manipulate the original page, which pose a security risk</li>
            <li><strong>rel = "noreferrer":</strong>value of the rel attribute provides both privacy and security. Prevents the new page from knowing where the user came from(<em>hiding the referrer</em> and also include the behavior of noopener <em> preventing the page from accessing the original page</em></li>
            </ul>
    <h3> Absolute and relative links</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Absolute link </h4>
            <p>Links to pages on other websites on the internet are called absolute links. A typical absolute link will be made up of the following parts: scheme://domain/path. An absolute link will always contain the scheme and domain of the destination.</p>
            <p><strong>example: "https://www.theodinproject.com/about"</strong></li></p>
            <p><em>scheme://domain/path</em></p>
        <li>
            <h4>Relavtive links</h4>
            <p>Links to other pages within our own website are called relative links. Relative links do not include the domain name, since it is another page on the same site, it assumes the domain name will be the same as the page we created the link on.</p>
            <a href = "./pages/about.html" target = "_blank">About</a>
            <p> only needed to do: href = "about.html"</p>
            <p>use ./ infront of link will prevent unexpected issue </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Images</h2>
    <p> A src element: img src = link</p>
    <p> just like href, it can embed an image using both absolute and relative paths</p>
    <img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png">
    <p>To display images on your website that are hosted on your own web server,  you can use the relative path </p>
    <img src="./images/dog.jpg" alt = "a dog picture" height="310" width="310">
    <h3> <strong>alt attribute</strong></h3>
    <p>describe an image, it will be used in place of an image if it cannot be loaded</p>
    <img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png" alt="The Odin Project Logo">
     <!-- It is good habit to always specify size attriutes on every image.  -->
